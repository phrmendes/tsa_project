  abstract = {Inflation volatility is said to reduce consumption by introducing more uncertainty to consumers who try to allocate their budget toward consumption and saving. Since exchange rate volatility contributes to inflation volatility, it is shown to have direct negative effect on consumption. Previous research established the link between exchange rate volatility and consumption using data from industrial countries. In this paper we provide a counter part by using data from 12 emerging economies. We find that while exchange rate uncertainty has short-run effects on domestic consumption of almost all countries, the short-run effects last into the long run only in half of the countries. Besides theoretical modeling of consumption behavior, the results also have important implications for business cycles and economic growth in emerging economies.},

  abstract = {Inflation uncertainty, measured by the volatility of inflation, is said to have a negative effect on domestic consumption by making the public more cautious about their spending. Since exchange rate volatility contributes to inflation volatility, we conjecture that it could have a direct effect on domestic consumption. We demonstrate our conjecture by specifying a consumption function that includes a measure of exchange rate volatility, in addition to its usual determinants. The model is estimated for each of the 17 countries in the sample using the boundstesting approach to cointegration and error-correction modeling. The results reveal that in 12 of the countries, exchange rate volatility has short-run effects on consumption. Long-run effects are observed in only 9 countries.},

  abstract = {In 1952, Alexander provided an argument that since inflationary effects of depreciation could shift income from workers to producers it could lead to a decline in aggregate domestic consumption. This was based on the assumption that wages do not adjust fully to inflation and labor has a high MPC relative to that of the producers. In this paper, we argue that in addition to the exchange rate itself, exchange rate uncertainty could also affect domestic consumption. We demonstrate our conjecture by using quarterly data from Japan and a bounds testing approach that distinguishes the short run from the long run.},

This guide was produced to accompany Advanced Macro-Economics: an Easy Guide, available open access from LSE Press. Macroeconomic concepts and theories are among the most valuable for policy makers. Yet up to now, there has been a wide gap between undergraduate courses and the professional level at which macroeconomic policy is practiced. In addition, PhD-level textbooks rarely address the needs of a policy audience. So advanced macroeconomics has not been easily accessible to current and aspiring practitioners. This rigorous yet accessible book fills that gap. It was born as a Masters course that each of the authors taught for many years at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. And it draws on the authors' own extensive practical experience as macroeconomic policymakers. It introduces the tools of dynamic optimization in the context of economic growth, and then applies them to policy questions ranging from pensions, consumption, investment and finance, to the most recent developments in fiscal and monetary policy. Written with a light touch, yet thoroughly explaining current theory and its application to policy-making, {$<$}em{$>$}Advanced Macroeconomics: An Easy Guide{$<$}/em{$>$} is an invaluable resource for graduate students, advanced undergraduate students, and practitioners.},

  abstract = {Consumption accounts for more than 70\% of GDP in both Pakistan and India and both countries face high debt to GDP ratio as well as current account deficit. Consequently, exchange rates are usually volatile and they directly affect major economic indicators in the respective countries. Therefore, this study examines the impact of the exchange rate and its volatility on consumption in Pakistan and India using the time series data from 1980 to 2018. The empirical models differentiate between real and nominal variables to isolate the impact of inflation pass-through. The long-run and short-run relationships are identified using the autoregressive distributive lag cointegration method. The results show that real and nominal exchange rates do not have a significant relationship with consumption in Pakistan. Whereas, in India, an increase in real exchange rate increases consumption while an increase in the nominal exchange rate reduces consumption, indicating inflation pass-through. The volatility of the real exchange rate has a positive relationship with consumption in Pakistan. In India, the volatility of the nominal exchange rate has a negative relationship with consumption; showing the presence of inflation pass-through effect in India. Our results show that domestic consumption in India is more prone to external shocks as compared to Pakistan, most probably due to a relatively higher degree of openness. Our results suggest that there is a long-run relationship between exchange rate volatility and consumption in both countries and the stabilization of the exchange rate can improve the sustainability of consumption in both India and Pakistan.},

  abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to examine the effects of exchange rate volatility on consumption by focusing on a small open sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) country, Ghana, which has experienced exchange rate volatility frequently. Design/methodology/approach The authors used annual data covering the period 1980-2015, the annualised variance of the real exchange rate as a measure of exchange rate volatility and a technique that is able to separate short-run effects from long-run effects. Findings The authors found that exchange rate volatility has negative effects on domestic consumption in the short run, which is passed on as negative long-run effects. This conclusion is unaffected by an alternative measure of exchange rate volatility and the choice of lag restrictions. Research limitations/implications The authors' finding suggests that policymakers should seek to reduce or prevent exchange rate volatility by pursuing various policies including limiting foreign currency transactions within the country and promoting quality exports. Originality/value The extant studies have examined the effects of exchange rate volatility on consumption by considering countries in regions other than SSA. This paper focuses on a small open SSA country which has experienced exchange rate volatility frequently. Unlike most studies, this paper differentiates short-run effects from long-run effects.},
